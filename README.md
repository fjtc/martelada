## Description

**martelada** is a very simple Java resource bundle translator tool designed to
help the creation of translations in java.

### About the name

**martelada**, in Portuguese, stands for **hammered**. I decided to use this
name because I wanted a quick-and-dirty tool to edit properties files.
